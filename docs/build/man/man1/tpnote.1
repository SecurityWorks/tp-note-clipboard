.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tp-Note is a note-taking tool and a template system, that synchronizes
the note\[cq]s metadata with its filename.
Tp-Note analyses its environment and the clipboard content and stores
the result in variables.
New notes are created by filling these variables in predefined and
customizable \f[I]Tera\f[R]-templates.
In case the first positional parameter `\f[C]<FILE>\f[R]' points to an
existing Tp-Note file, the note\[cq]s metadata is parsed and, if
necessary, its filename is adjusted.
For all other file types, Tp-Note creates a new note in the same
directory annotating the file.
If the positional parameter `\f[C]<DIR>\f[R]' points to an existing
directory (or, when omitted, the current working directory), a new note
is created in that directory.
After creation, Tp-Note launches the systems file editor.
Although the configurable default templates are written for Markdown,
Tp-Note is not tied to any specific markup language.
However, Tp-Note comes with an optional viewer feature, that currently
renders only Markdown, ReStructuredText and HTML input.
In addition, there is some limited support for Asciidoc and WikiText.
Finally, the note\[cq]s rendition is live updated and displayed in the
user\[cq]s web browser.
.PP
After the user finished editing, Tp-Note analyses eventual changes in
the notes metadata and renames, if necessary, the file, so that its
metadata and filename are in sync again.
Finally, the resulting path is printed to `\f[C]stdout\f[R]', log and
error messages are dumped to `\f[C]stderr\f[R]'.
.PP
This document is Tp-Note\[cq]s technical reference.
More information can be found in Tp-Note\[cq]s user
manual (https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/tpnote--manual.html)
and at Tp-Note\[cq]s project
page (https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/).
.SH OPERATION MODES
.PP
Tp-Note operates in 5 different modes, depending on its command line
arguments and the clipboard state.
Each mode is associated with one content template and one filename
template.
.SS Create a new note with empty clipboard
.PP
In case the clipboard is empty while starting, the new note is created
with the templates: `\f[C]tmpl.new_content\f[R]' and
`\f[C]tmpl.new_filename\f[R]'.
By default, the new note\[cq]s title is the parent\[cq]s directory name.
The newly created file is then opened with an external text editor,
allowing it to change the proposed title and add other content.
When the text editor closes, Tp-Note synchronizes the note\[cq]s
metadata and its filename.
This operation is performed with the `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]'
template.
.PP
Example: the clipboard is empty and \f[C]<path>\f[R] is a directory (or
empty):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> tpnote \[dq]./03-Favorite Readings/\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or

\f[R]

.SS Create a new note based on clipboard data
.PP
When `\f[C]<path>\f[R]' is a directory and the clipboard is not empty,
the clipboard\[cq]s content is stored in the variable
`\f[C]{{ clipboard }}\f[R]'.
In addition, if the content contains an hyperlink in Markdown format,
the hyperlink\[cq]s name can be accessed with
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_text }}\f[R]', its URL with
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_dest }}\f[R]' and its title with
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_title }}\f[R]'.
The new note is then created with the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]' and the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_filename\f[R]' templates.
Finally, the newly created note file is opened again with some external
text editor.
When the user closes the text editor, Tp-Note synchronizes the
note\[cq]s metadata and its filename with the template
`\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]'.

When no mouse and clipboard is available, the clipboard feature can be
simulated by feeding the clipboard data into \f[C]stdin\f[R]:

Tp-Note behaves here as if the clipboard contained the string:
\[lq]\f[C][The Rust Book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>)\f[R]\[rq].
.SS The clipboard contains a string
.PP
Example: While launching Tp-Note the clipboard contains the string:

.PP
We see from the above example, how the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]' content template extracts the
first line of the clipboards content and inserts it into the
header\[cq]s `\f[C]title:\f[R]' field.
Then, it copies the entire clipboard content into the body of the
document.
However, if desired or necessary, it is possible to modify all templates
in Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file.
Note, that not only the note\[cq]s content is created with a template,
but also its filename: The `\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_filename\f[R]'
filename template concatenates the current date, the note\[cq]s title
and subtitle.
.SS The clipboard contains a hyperlink
.PP
Example: \f[C]<path>\f[R] is a directory, the clipboard is not empty and
it contains the string:
\[lq]\f[C]I recommend:\[rs]n[The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)\f[R]\[rq].

.PP
When analyzing the clipboard\[cq]s content, Tp-Note searches for
hyperlinks in Markdown, ReStructuredText, Asciidoc and HTML format.
When successful, the content template uses the link text of the first
hyperlink found as document title.
.SS The clipboard contains a string with a YAML header
.PP
Example: `\f[C]<path>\f[R]' is a directory, the clipboard is not empty
and contains the string:
\[lq]\f[C]---\[rs]ntitle: Todo\[rs]nfile_ext: mdtxt\[rs]n---\[rs]n\[rs]nnothing\f[R]\[rq].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[R]

.PP
This creates the note: `\f[C]20211031-Todo.mdtxt\f[R]' with the
following content:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]Todo\[dq]

\f[R]

.PP
Technically, the creation of the new note is performed using the YAML
header variables: `\f[C]{{ fm_title }}\f[R]',
`\f[C]{{ fm_subtitle }}\f[R]', `\f[C]{{ fm_author }}\f[R]',
`\f[C]{{ fm_date }}\f[R]', `\f[C]{{ fm_lang }}\f[R]',
`\f[C]{{ fm_sort_tag }}\f[R]' and `\f[C]{{ fm_file_ext }}\f[R]' which
are evaluated with the `\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_content\f[R]'
and the `\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_filename\f[R]' templates.
.PP
Note, that the same result can also be achieved without clipboard input
by typing in a terminal:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> echo -e \[dq]---\[rs]ntitle: Todo\[rs]nfile_ext: mdtxt\[rs]n---\[rs]n\[rs]nnothing\[dq] | tpnote
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Furthermore, this operation mode is very handy with pipes in general, as
shows the following example: it downloads some webpage, converts it to
Markdown and copies the result into a Tp-Note file.
The procedure preserves the webpage\[cq]s title in the note\[cq]s title:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl \[aq]https://blog.getreu.net\[aq] | pandoc --standalone -f html -t markdown_strict+yaml_metadata_block | tpnote
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
creates the note file `\f[C]20211031-Jens Getreu\[aq]s blog.md\f[R]'

.SS Create a new note annotating a non-Tp-Note file
.PP
When `\f[C]<path>\f[R]' points to an existing file, whose file extension
is other than `\f[C].md\f[R]', a new note is created with a similar
filename and a reference to the original file is copied into the new
note\[cq]s body.
If the clipboard contains some text, it is appended there also.
The logic of this is implemented in the templates:
`\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_content\f[R]' and
`\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_filename\f[R]'.
Once the file is created, it is opened with an external text editor.
After editing the file, it will be - if necessary - renamed to be in
sync with the note\[cq]s metadata.

The configuration file variables `\f[C]filename.extensions_*\f[R]'
list all the file extensions that Tp-Note recognizes as own file types.
Only foreign file types can be annotated.
.PP
Note that the file annotation mode also reads the clipboard\[cq]s
content: when it is not empty, its data is appended to the new
note\[cq]s body.
.SS Convert a text file into a Tp-Note file
.PP
Consider the content of the following text file
`\f[C]Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md\f[R]' whose creation date is
13 March 2022:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
A little game designed for primary kids to revise vocabulary in classroom.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To convert the text file into a Tp-Note file type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> tpnote --add-header --batch \[dq]Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
NB: the `\f[C]--add-header\f[R]' flag is actually not necessary, as it
is enabled by default through the configuration file variable
`\f[C]arg_default.add_header = true\f[R]'.
.PP
As a result of the above command, Tp-Note converts the filename into:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
20220313-Ascii-Hangman--A game for children.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and prepends a YAML header to the file\[cq]s content:

\f[B]Use case: synchronize recursively filenames and metadata\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
The following synchronizes bidirectionally all filenames with the
note\[cq]s YAML header data.
.IP
.nf

> TPNOTEUSER=\[dq]John\[dq] find . -type f -name \[aq]*.md\[aq] -exec tpnote -a -b {} > /dev/null \[rs];
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The direction of the synchronization depends on whether the
`\f[C].md\f[R]' file has a valid YAML header or not:
.IP \[bu] 2
A YAML header is present and valid: the header fields might update the
filename (see template `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]').
A possible \f[I]sort-tag\f[R] at the beginning of the filename remains
untouched.
.IP \[bu] 2
No YAML header: a new header is prepended (see template
`\f[C]from_text_file_content\f[R]') and the filename might change
slightly (see template `\f[C]from_text_file_filename\f[R]').
A possible \f[I]sort-tag\f[R] at the beginning of the filename remains
untouched.
If the filename does not start with a sort tag, the current date is
prepended.
.RE
.SS Editing notes
.PP
Unless invoked with `\f[C]--batch\f[R]' or `\f[C]--view\f[R]', Tp-Note
launches an external text editor after creating a new note.
This also happens when `\f[C]<path>\f[R]' points to an existing
`\f[C].md\f[R]'-file.
.PP
Example: edit the note from the previous example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> cd \[dq]./03-Favorite Readings\[dq]
> tpnote 20211031-Favorite Readings--Note.md
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Automatic filename synchronization before and after editing
.PP
Before launching the text editor and after closing it, Tp-Note
synchronizes the filename with the note\[cq]s metadata.
When the user changes the metadata of a note, Tp-Note will replicate
that change in the note\[cq]s filename.
As a result, \f[I]all your note\[cq]s filenames always correspond to
their metadata\f[R], which helps to retrieve your notes in large data
pools.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> tpnote \[dq]20200306-Favorite Readings--Note.md\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The way how Tp-Note synchronizes the note\[cq]s metadata and filename is
defined in the template `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]'.
.PP
Once Tp-Note opens the file in an text editor, the person taking notes
may decide updating the title in the note\[cq]s YAML metadata section
from `\f[C]title: \[dq]Favorite Readings\[dq]\f[R]' to
`\f[C]title: \[dq]Introduction to bookkeeping\[dq]\f[R]'.
After closing the text editor the filename is automatically updated too
and looks like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]20200306-Introduction to bookkeeping--Note.md\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note: the sort tag `\f[C]20200306-\f[R]' has not changed.
The filename synchronization mechanism by default never does.
(See below for more details about filename synchronization).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-a\f[R], \f[B]--add-header\f[R]
Prepend a YAML header in case the text file does not have one.
The default template, deduces the `\f[C]title:\f[R]' and
`\f[C]subtitle:\f[R]' header field from the filename.
It\[cq]s sort-tag and file extension remain untouched.
In case the filename is lacking a \f[I]sort-tag\f[R], the file creation
date in numerical format is prepended.
As this option is activated by default, it has no effect unless you set
`\f[C]arg_default.add_header = false\f[R]' in the configuration file.
.TP
\f[B]-b\f[R], \f[B]--batch\f[R]
Do not launch the external text editor or viewer.
All other operations are available and are executed in the same way.
In batch mode, error messages are dumped on the console only and no
alert windows pop up.
Tp-Note ignores the clipboard when run in batch mode with
`\f[C]--batch\f[R]'.
Instead, if available, it reads the \f[C]stdin\f[R] stream as if the
data came from the clipboard.
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]--config\f[R]=\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Load the alternative config file \f[I]FILE\f[R] instead of the default
one.
.TP
\f[B]-d\f[R] \f[I]LEVEL\f[R], \f[B]--debug\f[R]=\f[I]LEVEL\f[R]
Print additional log messages.
The debug level \f[I]LEVEL\f[R] must be one out of `\f[C]trace\f[R]',
`\f[C]debug\f[R]', `\f[C]info\f[R]', `\f[C]warn\f[R]', `\f[C]error\f[R]'
(default) or `\f[C]off\f[R]'.
The level `\f[C]trace\f[R]' reports the most detailed information, while
`\f[C]error\f[R]' informs you only about failures.
A `\f[C]warn\f[R]' level message means, that not all functionality might
be available or work as expected.
Use `\f[C]-b -d trace\f[R]' for debugging templates.
If the HTTP server (viewer) does not work as expected:
`\f[C]-n -d debug\f[R]'.
If your text editor does not open as expected:
`\f[C]-n -d info --edit\f[R]'.
Or, to observe the launch of the web browser:
`\f[C]-n -d info --view\f[R]'.
The option `\f[C]-d trace\f[R]' shows all available template variables,
the templates used and the rendered result of the substitution.
This is particularly useful for debugging new templates.
The option `\f[C]-d off\f[R]' silences all error message reporting and
also suppresses the error popup windows.
All error messages are dumped in the error stream \f[C]stderr\f[R] and
appear on the console from where Tp-Note was launched:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tpnote.exe --debug info my_note.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On Windows the output must be redirected into a file to see it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tpnote.exe --debug info my_note.md >debug.md 2>&1
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively, you can redirect all log file entries into popup alert
windows.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tpnote.exe --popup --debug info my_note.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The same can be achieved by setting following configuration file
variables (especially useful with Windows):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[arg_default]
debug = \[aq]info\[aq]
popup = true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The value for `\f[C]arg_default.debug\f[R]' must be one out of
`\f[C]trace\f[R]', `\f[C]debug\f[R]', `\f[C]info\f[R]',
`\f[C]warn\f[R]', `\f[C]error\f[R]' (default) and `\f[C]off\f[R]'.
They have the same meaning as the corresponding command line options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--edit\f[R]
Edit only mode: opens the external text editor, but not the file viewer.
This disables Tp-Note\[cq]s internal file watcher and web server, unless
`\f[C]-v\f[R]' is given.
Another way to permanently disable the web server is to set the
configuration variable `\f[C]arg_default.edit=true\f[R]'.
When `\f[C]--edit --view\f[R]' appear together, both the editor and the
viewer will open and the \f[C]arg_default.edit\f[R] variable is
ignored.
.TP
\f[B]-p\f[R], \f[B]--port\f[R]=\f[I]PORT\f[R]
Sets the server port that the web browser connects to, to the specified
value \f[I]PORT\f[R].
If not given, a random available port is chosen automatically.
.TP
\f[B]-n\f[R], \f[B]--no-filename-sync\f[R]
Whenever Tp-Note opens a note file, it synchronizes its YAML-metadata
with its filename.
`\f[C]--no-filename-sync\f[R]' disables the synchronization.
In addition, the \[lq]flag in scripts\[rq] can be especially useful for
testing `\f[C].md\f[R]'-files.
See section EXIT STATUS for more details.
The section METADATA FILENAME SYNCHRONIZATION shows alternative ways to
disable synchronization.
.TP
\f[B]-t\f[R], \f[B]--tty\f[R]
Tp-Note tries different heuristics to detect whether a graphic
environment is available or not.
For example, under Linux, the `\f[C]DISPLAY\f[R]' environment variable
is evaluated.
The `\f[C]--tty\f[R]' flag disables the automatic detection and sets
Tp-Note into \[lq]console only\[rq] mode: now only the non GUI editor
(see configuration variable: `\f[C][app_args] editor_console\f[R]') and
no viewer is launched.
.TP
\f[B]-u\f[R], \f[B]--popup\f[R]
Redirect log file entries into popup alert windows.
Must be used together with the \f[B]--debug\f[R] option to have an
effect.
Note, that debug level `\f[C]error\f[R]' conditions will always trigger
popup messages, regardless of \f[B]--popup\f[R] and \f[B]--debug\f[R]
(unless `\f[C]--debug off\f[R]').
Popup alert windows are queued and will never interrupt
\f[I]Tp-Note\f[R].
To better associate a particular action with its log events, read
through all upcoming popup alert windows until they fail to appear.
.TP
\f[B]-v\f[R], \f[B]--view\f[R]
View only mode: do not open the external text editor.
This flag instructs Tp-Note to start an internal file watcher and web
server and connect the system\[cq]s default web browser to view the note
file and to observe live file modifications.
The configuration setting `\f[C]arg_default.edit=true\f[R]' disables
the viewer.
However, with `\f[C]--view\f[R]' given at the command line, the viewer
appears, regardless of the value of `\f[C]arg_default.edit\f[R]'.
As most users do not expect the viewed file to change,
`\f[C]--view\f[R]' is usually used together with
`\f[C]--no-filename-sync\f[R]'.
.TP
\f[B]-V\f[R], \f[B]--version\f[R]
Print Tp-Note\[cq]s version, its built-in features and the path to the
sourced configuration file.
The output is YAML formatted for further automatic processing.
.TP
\f[B]-x\f[R] \f[I]DIRECTORY\f[R], \f[B]--export\f[R]=\f[I]DIRECTORY\f[R]
Print the note as HTML rendition into \f[I]DIRECTORY\f[R].
`\f[C]-x -\f[R]' prints to \f[I]stdout\f[R].
The empty string, e.g.\ `\f[C]--export=\f[R]' or
`\f[C]-x \[dq]\[dq]\f[R]', defaults to the directory where the note file
resides.
No external text editor or viewer is launched.
Can be combined with `\f[C]--batch\f[R]' to avoid popup error alert
windows.
.TP
\f[B]--export-link-rewriting\f[R]=\f[I]MODE\f[R]
Choose how local links in the exported HTML file are written out:
`\f[C]off\f[R]', `\f[C]short\f[R]' or `\f[C]long\f[R]' (default).
No link rewriting occurs, for the \f[I]MODE\f[R] `\f[C]off\f[R]'.
The \f[I]MODE\f[R] `\f[C]short\f[R]' rewrites all local relative links
to absolute links, whose base is the first parent directory containing
the marker file `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' (filename customizable).
NB, the directory of the marker file defines the base for all absolute
local links in your Tp-Note file! The mode `\f[C]long\f[R]' rewrites
\f[I]all\f[R] local links to absolute links whose base is the
system\[cq]s root directory `\f[C]/\f[R]'.
For relative local links this is performed by prepending the path to the
note file.
Absolute local links get the path to the marker file
`\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' prepended.
In case you do not place a `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' file in a parent
directory, the base for absolute local links in your note file is
interpreted as `\f[C]/\f[R]'.
The right mode to choose depends on how you view the resulting HTML: if
you publish on a web server, then `\f[C]short\f[R]' is a good choice.
If you view the HTML file directly in your web browser, better choose
`\f[C]long\f[R]'.
NB: You can also set this option via Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file
<<<<<<< HEAD
with the key `\f[C][arg_default] export_link_rewriting\f[R]'.

.SH THE NOTE\[cq]S DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
.PP
Tp-Note considers a text file to be a valid note file, if its:
.IP \[bu] 2
file extension is listed in one of the configuration file variables
`\f[C]filename.extension_*\f[R]'; if its
.IP \[bu] 2
content has a valid YAML header and
.IP \[bu] 2
the YAML header contains a key whose name is defined in the
configuration file variable `\f[C]tmpl.compulsory_header_field\f[R]'
(default `\f[C]title\f[R]').
.PP
A Tp-Note note file is always UTF-8 encoded.
As newline, either the Unix standard `\f[C]\[rs]n\f[R]' or the Windows
standard `\f[C]\[rs]r\[rs]n\f[R]' is accepted.
Tp-Note writes out newlines according the operating system it runs on.
.SS The document\[cq]s header and body
.PP
Tp-Note is designed to be compatible with `\f[C]Pandoc\f[R]\[cq]s
and'\f[C]RMarkdown\f[R]s document structure as shown in the figure
below.
In this documentation the terms \[lq]YAML header\[rq], \[lq]header\[rq]
and \[lq]front matter\[rq] are used as synonyms to designate to
document\[cq]s metadata block at the beginning of the text file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
<YAML-front-matter>
---
<document-body>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The YAML front-matter starts at the beginning of the document with
`\f[C]---\f[R]' and ends with `\f[C]...\f[R]' or `\f[C]---\f[R]'.
Note that according to the YAML standard, string literals are always
encoded as JSON strings.
By convention, a valid Tp-Note file has at least one YAML field named
`\f[C]title:\f[R]' (the name of this compulsory field is defined by the
`\f[C]tmpl.compulsory_header_field\f[R]' variable in the configuration
file and can be changed there).
.PP
Note that prepended text, placed before the YAML front-matter, is
ignored.
There are however certain restrictions: If present, the skipped text
should not be too long (cf.\ constant
`\f[C]BEFORE_HEADER_MAX_IGNORED_CHARS\f[R]' in the source code of
Tp-Note) and it must be followed by at least one blank line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Prepended text is ignored.

---
<YAML-front-matter>
---
<document-body>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There is no restriction about the markup language being used in the
note\[cq]s text body.
However, the default templates assume Markdown and the file extension
`\f[C].md\f[R]'.
Both can be changed easily by adapting Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file.
Besides the requirements concerning its header, a valid Tp-Note file
must have a filename extension that is listed in one of the
configuration file variables: `\f[C]filename.extension_*\f[R]'.
The latter also determine which internal markup language render is
called for Tp-Note\[cq]s internal viewer.
.SS Links to resources and other documents
.PP
The document\[cq]s body often contains (inline) links to resources
e.g.\ images and links to other documents.
The link syntax depends on the markup language used in the Tp-Note file.
.PP
Here some example links written in Markdown:
.IP \[bu] 2
Website: `\f[C][blog](https://blog.getreu.net)\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
Inline image with relative local URL:
`\f[C]![Alt text](<images/my logo.png>)\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
Link to another Tp-Note document with relative local link:
`\f[C][my doc](<../../notes/my doc.md>)\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
The same as above, but using the short autolink syntax:
`\f[C]<http:../../notes/my%20doc.md>\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
Link to another Tp-Note document with absolute local link:
`\f[C][my doc](</home/kanban/documents/my note.md)\f[R]' The base for
absolute local links is the first parent directory containing the marker
file `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]'.
If absent, absolute local links refer to the root directory
`\f[C]/\f[R]'.
.PP
Although Tp-Note\[cq]s built in viewer follows absolute and relative
URLs, usually the latter are preferred, because it allows you to move
more easily documents and its resources in the file system.
.PP
Tp-Note\[cq]s exporter function `\f[C]--export\f[R]' converts a given
Tp-Note file into HTML and adds `\f[C].html\f[R]' to the output
filename.
Links in the documents content to other Tp-Note files are hereby
rewritten by appending `\f[C].html\f[R]' to their URLs.
This way you can convert groups of documents to HTML and later browse
from document to document in you web browser.
The option `\f[C]--export-link-rewriting\f[R]' allows you to finetune
how local links are written out.
Valid values are: `\f[C]off\f[R]', `\f[C]short\f[R]' and
`\f[C]long\f[R]'.
.PP
In order to achieve this, the user must respect the following convention
concerning absolute local links in Tp-Note documents: The base of
absolute local links in Tp-Note documents must be the directory where
the marker file `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' resides (or `\f[C]/\f[R]' in non
exists).
The option `\f[C]--export-link- rewriting\f[R]' decides how local links
in the Tp-Note document are converted when the HTML is generated.
If its value is `\f[C]short\f[R]', then relative local links are
converted to absolute links.
The base of the resulting links is where the \f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R] file
resides (or \f[C]/\f[R] if none exists).
Consider the following example:
.IP \[bu] 2
The Tp-Note file `\f[C]/my/docs/car/bill.md\f[R]' contains
.IP \[bu] 2
the absolute link `\f[C]/car/scan.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
and the relative link `\f[C]./photo.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
The document root marker is: `\f[C]/my/docs/.tpnoteroot\f[R]'.
.PP
The images in the resulting HTML will appear as
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]/car/scan.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]/car/photo.jpg\f[R]'.
.PP
For `\f[C]--export-link-rewriting=long\f[R]', in addition to the above,
all absolute local links are rebased to `\f[C]/\f[R]'\[cq].
Consider the following example:
.IP \[bu] 2
The Tp-Note file `\f[C]/my/docs/car/bill.md\f[R]' contains
.IP \[bu] 2
the absolute link `\f[C]/car/scan.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
and the relative link `\f[C]./photo.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
The document root marker is: `\f[C]/my/docs/.tpnoteroot\f[R]'.
.PP
The images in the resulting HTML will appear as
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]/my/docs/car/scan.jpg\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]/my/docs/car/photo.jpg\f[R]'.
.PP
So far we have seen how Tp-Note\[cq]s viewer and HTML exporter converts
the \f[I]target\f[R] of local links `\f[C][text](target)\f[R]'.
For the \f[I]text\f[R] property the situation is simpler as it never
changes.
However, there is one exception: when the text contains a URL starting
with `\f[C]http:\f[R]' or `\f[C]https:\f[R]' only the file stem is
displayed.
For example, the link:
`\f[C][http:dir/my file.md](<http:dir/my file.md>)\f[R]' is rewritten
into `\f[C][my file](<http:dir/my file.md>)\f[R]' before being rendered.
This explains why the autolink `\f[C]<http:dir/my file.md>.\f[R]'
appears as `\f[C]my file\f[R]' in the browser.
.SH METADATA FILENAME SYNCHRONIZATION
.PP
Consider the following Tp-Note file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
20151208-Make this world a better place--Suggestions.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The filename has 4 parts:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{ fm_sort_tag }}{{ fm_title }}--{{ fm_subtitle }}.{{ fm_file_ext }}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A so-called \f[I]sort tag\f[R] is a numerical prefix at the beginning of
the filename.
It is used to order files and notes in the file system.
Besides numerical digits and whitespace, a \f[I]sort tag\f[R] can be any
combination of \f[C]-_.\f[R][\[ha]sort tag] and is usually used as
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]chronological sort tag\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP

\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.PP
When Tp-Note creates a new note, it will automatically prepend a
\f[I]chronological sort tag\f[R] of today.
The `\f[C]{{ fm_title }}\f[R]' part is usually derived from the parent
directory name omitting its own \f[I]sort tag\f[R].
.PP
[\[ha]sort tag]: The characters `\f[C]_\f[R]', `\f[C]-\f[R]',
`\f[C]\f[R]', `\f[C]\[rs]t\f[R]' and `\f[C].\f[R]' are considered to be
part of the \f[I]sort tag\f[R] even when they appear in last position.
.PP
A note\[cq]s filename is in sync with its meta data, when the following
is true (slightly simplified, see the configuration file for the
complete definition):
.RS
.PP
filename on disk without \f[I]sort tag\f[R] ==
`\f[C]{{ fm_title }}--{{ fm_subtitle }}.md\f[R]' [1]
.RE
.PP
Consider the following document with the filename:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
20211031-My file.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and the content:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]1. The Beginning\[dq]
subtitle:   \[dq]Note\[dq]
author:     \[dq]getreu\[dq]
date:       \[dq]2021-10-31\[dq]
lang:       \[dq]en-GB\[dq]
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
As \[lq]\f[C]-My file.md\f[R]\[rq] is not equal to
\[lq]\f[C]-\[aq]1. The Beginning--Note.md\f[R]\[rq], Tp-Note will rename
the file to \[lq]\f[C]20211031-\[aq]1. The Beginning--Note.md\f[R]\[rq].
If the filename had been \[lq]\f[C]05_02-My file.md\f[R]\[rq], it would
rename it to \[lq]\f[C]05_02-\[aq]1. The Beginning--Note.md\f[R]\[rq].
.PP
Note: When the YAML front-matter does not contain the optional
`\f[C]sort_tag\f[R]' variable, Tp-Note will never change a sort tag.
Nevertheless, it might change the rest of the filename!
.PP
The reason why by default Tp-Note does not change sort tags is, that
they define their order in the file listing.
In general this order is independent of the notes content.
The simplest way to organize the sort tags of your files is by renaming
them directly in your file system.
Nevertheless, in some cases you might want to have full control over the
whole filename through the note\[cq]s YAML front-matter.
For example, if \[em] for some reason \[em] you have changed the
document\[cq]s date in the front-matter and you want to change the
chronological sort tag in one go.
In order to overwrite the note\[cq]s sort tag on disk, you can add a
`\f[C]sort_tag\f[R]' variable to its front-matter:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]1. The Beginning\[dq]
date:       \[dq]2021-10-31\[dq]
sort_tag:   \[dq]20211101-\[dq]
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When Tp-Note synchronizes the note\[cq]s metadata with its filename, it
will also change the sort tag from `\f[C]20211031-\f[R]' to
`\f[C]20211101-\f[R]'.
The resulting filename becomes
\[lq]\f[C]20211101-\[aq]1. The Beginning--Note.md\f[R]\[rq].
.PP
The `\f[C]sort_tag\f[R]' variable also becomes handy, when you want to
create one single note without any sort tag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]1. The Beginning\[dq]
sort_tag:   \[dq]\[dq]
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the same way, how it is possible to pin the sort tag of the note from
within the note\[cq]s metadata, you can also change the file extension
by adding the optional `\f[C]file_ext\f[R]' variable into the note\[cq]s
front-matter:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]1. The Beginning\[dq]
file_ext:   \[dq]rst\[dq]
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will change the file extension from `\f[C].md\f[R]' to
\[cq]\f[C].rst\f[R].
The resulting filename becomes
\[lq]\f[C]20211101-\[aq]1. The Beginning--Note.rst\f[R]\[rq].
.PP
Important: `\f[C]rst\f[R]' must be one of the registered file extensions
listed in the `\f[C]filename.extensions_rst\f[R]' variables in
Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file.
If needed you can add more extensions there.
If the new filename extension is not listed in one of these variables,
Tp-Note will not be able to recognize the note file as such and will not
open it in the external text editor and viewer.
.PP
Note: When a `\f[C]sort_tag\f[R]' variable is defined in the note\[cq]s
YAML header, you should not change the sort tag string in the note\[cq]s
file name manually by renaming the file, as your change will be
overwritten next time you open the note with Tp-Note.
However, you can switch back to Tp-Note\[cq]s default behavior any time
by deleting the `\f[C]sort_tag\f[R]' line in the note\[cq]s metadata.
The same applies to the `\f[C]file_ext\f[R]' variable.
.PP
The metadata filename synchronization feature can be disabled
permanently by setting the configuration file variable
`\f[C]arg_default.no_filename_sync = true\f[R]'.
To disable this feature for one time only, invoke Tp-Note with
`\f[C]--no-filename-sync\f[R]'.
To exclude a particular note from filename synchronization, add the YAML
header field `\f[C]filename_sync: false\f[R]'.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:      \[dq]1. The Beginning\[dq]
filename_sync: false
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note, that in the above described examples, the information flow goes
always from the YAML note header towards the note\[cq]s filename.
However, when Tp-Note opens a text file without a YAML header, a new
header is added automatically.
In this case the information flow goes from the filename towards the
header, namely in the opposite direction.
Once the new header is prepended to the text file, a regular filename
synchronization - as described above - is triggered and executed as
described above.
.PP
Technically, all rules and logic of how the synchronisation is executed,
are encoded in customizable so called filename templates (cf.\ section
\f[I]Templates\f[R]).
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
.PP
Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file resides typically in
`\f[C]\[ti]/.config/tpnote/tpnote.toml\f[R]' on Unix or in
`\f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]<LOGIN>\[rs]AppData\[rs]Roaming\[rs]tpnote\[rs]config\[rs]tpnote.toml>\f[R]'
on Windows.
`\f[C]tpnote --version\f[R]' prints the current configuration file path.
When Tp-Note starts, it first tries to find its configuration file.
If it fails, it writes a default configuration file.
Tp-Note is best customized by starting it once, and then modifying its
default configuration.
For a detailed description of the available configuration variables,
please consult the `\f[C]const\f[R]' definitions in Tp-Note\[cq]s source
code file `\f[C]config.rs\f[R]' The configuration file is encoded
according to the TOML standard.
.SS Register your own text editor
.PP
The configuration file variables `\f[C][app_args] editor\f[R]' and
`\f[C][app_args] editor_console\f[R]' define lists of external text
editors to be launched for editing.
The lists contain by default well-known text editor names and their
command line arguments.
Tp-Note tries to launch every text editor in
`\f[C][app_args] editor\f[R]' from the beginning of the list until it
finds an installed text editor.
When Tp-Note is started on a Linux console, the list
`\f[C][app_args] editor_console\f[R]' is used instead.
Here you can register text editors that do not require a graphical
environment, e.g.\ `\f[C]vim\f[R]' or `\f[C]nano\f[R]'.
In order to use your own text editor, just place it at the top of the
list.
To debug your changes invoke Tp-Note with
`\f[C]tpnote --debug info --popup --edit\f[R]'
.PP
The following example showcases the configuration for the \f[I]Kate\f[R]
file editor.
The entry `\f[C]kate\f[R]' launches the binary, while the command line
parameter `\f[C]--block\f[R]' guarantees, that the launched process
blocks until the user closes the editor.
Tp-Note detects the end of the process, checks if the title of the note
files has changed in its YAML header and renames the note file if
necessary.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
editor = [
  [
    \[aq]kate\[aq],
    \[aq]--block\[aq]
  ]
]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When you configure Tp-Note to work with your text editor, make sure,
that your text editor does not fork! You can check this by launching the
text editor from the command line: if the command prompt returns
immediately, then the file editor forks the process.
On the other hand everything is OK, when the command prompt only comes
back at the moment the text editor is closed.
Many text editors provide an option to restrain from forking: for
example the \f[I]VScode\f[R]-editor can be launched with the
`\f[C]--wait\f[R]' option, \f[I]Vim\f[R] with `\f[C]--nofork\f[R]' or
\f[I]Kate\f[R] with `\f[C]--block\f[R]' (see example above).
However, Tp-Note also works with forking text editors.
Although this should be avoided, there is a possible workaround:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> FILE=$(tpnote --batch) # Create the new note.
> mytexteditor \[dq]$FILE\[dq]    # The prompt returns immediatly as the editor forks.
> tpnote --view \[dq]$FILE\[dq]  # Launch Tp-Note\[aq]s viewer.
>                         # After the editing is done...
> tpnote --batch \[dq]$FILE\[dq] # Synchronize the note\[aq]s filename.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Remark for the advanced console user: In a similar way, you can launch a
different text editor than the one configured in Tp-Note\[cq]s
configuration file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> FILE=$(tpnote --batch); vi \[dq]$FILE\[dq]; tpnote --batch \[dq]$FILE\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Whereby `\f[C]FILE=$(tpnote --batch)\f[R]' creates the note file,
`\f[C]vi \[dq]$FILE\[dq]\f[R]' opens the `\f[C]vi\f[R]'-text editor and
`\f[C]tpnote --batch \[dq]$FILE\[dq]\f[R]' synchronizes the filename.
.PP
\f[B]Register a Flatpak Markdown editor\f[R]
.PP
Flathub for Linux (https://www.flathub.org/home) is a cross-platform
application repository that works well with Tp-Note.
To showcase an example, we will add a Tp-Note launcher for the \f[I]Mark
Text\f[R] Markdown text editor available as Flatpak
package (https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.marktext.marktext).
Before installing, make sure that you have set up
Flatpack (https://flatpak.org/setup/) correctly.
Then install the application with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> sudo flatpak install flathub com.github.marktext.marktext
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To test, run \f[I]Mark Text\f[R] from the command line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> flatpak run com.github.marktext.marktext
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then open Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file \f[C]tpnote.toml\f[R] and
search for the `\f[C][app_args] editor\f[R]' variable, quoted shortened
below:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[app_args]
editor = [
    [
    \[aq]code\[aq],
    \[aq]-w\[aq],
    \[aq]-n\[aq],
],
#...
]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The structure of this variable is a list of lists.
Every item in the outer list corresponds to one entire command line
launching a different text editor, here \f[I]VSCode\f[R].
When launching, Tp-Note searches through this list until it finds an
installed text editor on the system.
.PP
In this example, we register the \f[I]Mark Text\f[R] editor at the first
place in this list, by inserting
`\f[C][\[aq]flatpak\[aq], \[aq]run\[aq], \[aq]com.github.marktext.marktext\[aq]]\f[R]':
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[app_args]

    \[aq]-w\[aq],
    \[aq]-n\[aq],
],
#...
]
\f[R]

Save the modified configuration file.
Next time you launch Tp-Note, the \f[I]Mark Text\f[R]-editor will open
with your note.
.PP
\f[B]Register a console text editor running in a terminal emulator\f[R]

In this setup Tp-Note launches the terminal emulator which is configured
to launch the text editor as child process.
Neither process should fork when they start (see above).

.SS Change the file extension for new note files
.PP
Tp-Note identifies the note\[cq]s markup language by its file extension
and renders the content accordingly (see
`\f[C]filename.extensions_*\f[R]' variables).
For example: the variable `\f[C]filename.extensions_md\f[R]' lists all
file extensions, that are regarded as Markdown files:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[filename]
extensions_md = [ \[aq]txt\[aq], \[aq]md\[aq], \[aq]markdown\[aq] ]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The default file extension for new note files under Windows is defined
as:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[filename]
extension_default = \[aq]txt\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you prefer rather the file extension `\f[C]md\f[R]' for new notes,
change this to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[filename]
extension_default = \[aq]md\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This modification does not change how the note file\[cq]s content is
interpreted - in this case as Markdown - because both file extensions
`\f[C].txt\f[R]' and `\f[C].md\f[R]' belong to the same extension group
defined in `\f[C]filename.extensions_md\f[R]'.
.SS Change the default markup language
.PP
Tp-Note\[cq]s core functionality, the management of note file headers
and filenames, is markup language agnostic.
However, there is one content template
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]' that generates a hyperlink.
The hyperlink syntax varies depending on the markup language.
Hence, you should not forget to modify the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]' content template, when you
change the default markup language defined in
`\f[C]filename.extension_default\f[R]'.
.SS Change default markup language to ReStructuredText
.PP
Tp-Note\[cq]s core function is a template system and as such it depends
very little on the used markup language.
The default templates are designed in a way that they contain almost no
markup specific code.
There is one little exception though.
The following configuration variables affect the way new notes are
created:
.IP "1." 3
Change the default file extension for new notes from:
.RS 4
.IP

\f[C]

.PP
to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

extension_default=\[aq]rst\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.IP "2." 3

[{{ path | tag }}{{ path | stem }}{{ path | ext | prepend_dot }}](<{{ path | tag }}{{ path | stem }}{{ path | ext | prepend_dot }}>)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
with the following line encoded in ReStructuredText syntax:

\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.PP
As a result, all future notes are created as `\f[C]*.rst\f[R]' files.
.SS Change the markup language for one specific note only
.PP
You can change the Markup language of a specific note by adding the
variable `\f[C]file_ext:\f[R]' to its YAML header.
For example, for ReStructuredText add:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
title:    \[dq]some note\[dq]
file_ext: \[dq]rst\[dq]
---
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When Tp-Note triggers the next filename synchronization, the filename
extension of the note file will change to `\f[C].rst\f[R]'.
The above modification applies to the current note only.
.SS Change the sort tag character set
.PP
\f[I]Sort tags\f[R] for new notes are generated with the
`\f[C][TMPL] *_filename\f[R]' templates and updated with the
`\f[C][TMPL] sync_filename\f[R]' template.
.PP
By default, the characters `\f[C]_\f[R]', `\f[C]-\f[R]',
\f[I]space\f[R], `\f[C]\[rs]t\f[R]' and `\f[C].\f[R]' are recognized as
being part of a \f[I]sort tag\f[R] when they appear at the beginning of
a filename.
This set of characters can be modified with the
`\f[C]filename.sort_tag_chars\f[R]' configuration variable.
In addition, one special character
`\f[C]filename.sort_tag_extra_separator\f[R]' (by default
`\f[C]\[aq]\f[R]') is sometimes used as \[lq]end of sort tag marker\[rq]
to avoid ambiguity.
.SS Customize the filename synchronization scheme
.PP
The filename synchronization scheme is fully customizable through
\f[I]Tp-Note\[cq]s filename templates\f[R].
To design such a custom scheme, start to set up your synchronization
rules in the `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template.
Then adjust all `\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]' templates to comply with
these rules.
In order to verify your design, check that the following holds for any
sequential application of one `\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]' template
followed directly by the `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template: The
latter should never change the filename initially set up by any
`\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]' template.
.PP
Secondly, make sure that the expression in
`\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' describing the filename\[cq]s \f[I]sort
tag\f[R] e.g.\ `\f[C]{{ path | tag }}\f[R]' is always followed by a
variable with the `\f[C]sanit(force_alpha=true)\f[R]' filter set, e.g.:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{ path | tag }}{{ fm_title | sanit(force_alpha=true) }}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The first expression guarantees, that it resolves only to characters
defined in the `\f[C]filename.sort_tag_chars\f[R]' set, while the
second expression is known to not start with such a character.
This way Tp-Note is able to separate \f[I]sort tags\f[R] in filenames
and avoids cyclic filename change.
Or, in other words: the `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filname\f[R]' template should
always give the same result, even after repeated application.
.PP
To debug your `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template, create a test
note file `\f[C]test.md\f[R]' and invoke Tp-Note with
`\f[C]--debug trace\f[R]' and `\f[C]--batch\f[R]':
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tpnote --batch --debug trace test.md
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Store new note files by default in a subdirectory
.PP
When you are annotating an existing file on disk, the new note file is
placed in the same directory by default.
To configure Tp-Note to store the new note file in a subdirectory,
let\[cq]s say `\f[C]Notes/\f[R]', instead, you need to modify the
templates `\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_filename\f[R]' and
`\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_content\f[R]':
.PP
Replace in `\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_filename\f[R]' the string:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{ path | tag }}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Notes/{{ path | tag }}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and in `\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_content\f[R]':
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[{{ path | filename }}](<{{ path | filename }}>)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[{{ path | filename }}](<../{{ path | filename }}>)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Please note that web browsers usually ignore leading `\f[C]../\f[R]' in
relative URL paths.
To work around this limitation, Tp-Note\[cq]s built-in viewer first
replaces `\f[C]../\f[R]' with the string `\f[C]ParentDir\f[R]'.
When the user clicks on this relative URL, the `\f[C]ParentDir\f[R]'
string in the HTTP request replaced back with `\f[C]..\f[R]'.
It is also worth mentioning that Tp-Note automatically creates the
subdirectory `\f[C]Notes/\f[R]' in case it does not exist.
.SS Customize the built-in note viewer
.PP
\f[B]Delay the launch of the web browser\f[R]
.PP
By default, Tp-Note launches two external programs: some text editor and
a web browser.
If wished for, the configuration variable
`\f[C][viewer] startup_delay\f[R]' allows to delay the launch of the web
browser some milliseconds.
This way the web browser window will always appear on top of the editor
window.
A negative value delays the start of the text editor instead.
.PP
\f[B]Change the way how note files are rendered for viewing\f[R]
.PP
Besides its core function, Tp-Note comes with several built-in markup
renderer and viewer, allowing to work with different markup languages at
the same time.
The configuration file variables `\f[C]filename.extensions_*\f[R]'
determine which markup renderer is used for which note file extension.
Depending on the markup language, this feature is more or less advanced
and complete: \f[I]Markdown\f[R]
(cf.\ `\f[C]filename.extensions_md\f[R]') is best supported and
feature complete: It complies with the \f[I]Common Mark\f[R]
specification.
The \f[I]ReStructuredText\f[R] renderer
(cf.\ `\f[C]filename.extensions_rst\f[R]') is quite new and still in
experimental state.
For all other supported markup languages Tp-Note provides a built-in
markup source text viewer (cf.\ `\f[C]filename.extensions_txt\f[R]')
that shows the note as typed (without markup), but renders all
hyperlinks to make them clickable.
In case none of the above rendition engines suit you, it is possible to
disable the viewer feature selectively for some particular note file
extensions: just place these extensions in the
`\f[C]filename.extensions_no_viewer\f[R]' variable.
If you wish to disable the viewer feature overall, set the variable
\f[C]arg_default.edit = true\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Change the HTML rendition template\f[R]
.PP
After the markup rendition process, Tp-Note\[cq]s built-in viewer
generates its final HTML rendition through the customizable HTML
templates `\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer\f[R]' and
`\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer_error\f[R]'.
The following code example taken from `\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer\f[R]'
illustrates the available variables:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[tmpl_html]
viewer = \[aq]\[aq]\[aq]<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=\[dq]{{ fm_lang | default(value=\[aq]en\[aq]) }}\[dq]>

.PP
Specifically:
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' are the deserialized header variables.
All content template variables and filters are available.
See section \f[I]Template variables\f[R] above.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_css_path }}\f[R]' is the CSS stylesheet path required to
highlight embedded source code.
This path is hard-wired and understood by Tp-Note\[cq]s internal web
server.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_fm_text }}\f[R]' is the raw UTF-8 copy of the header.
Not to be confounded with the dictionary variable
`\f[C]{{ fm_all }}\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_body_html }}\f[R]' is the note\[cq]s body as HTML
rendition.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_js }}\f[R]' is the JavaScript browser code for live
updates.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ extension_default }}\f[R]' (c.f.

.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ username }}\f[R]' (c.f.

.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ lang }}\f[R]' (c.f.
section \f[I]Template variables\f[R]).
.PP
Alternatively, the header enclosed by `\f[C]<pre>...</pre>\f[R]' can
also be rendered as a table:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  <table>
    <tr><th>title:</th><th>{{ fm_title }}</th> </tr>
    <tr><th>subtitle:</th><th>{{ fm_subtitle | default(value=\[aq]\[aq]) }}</th></tr>
  {% for k, v in fm_all| remove(var=\[aq]fm_title\[aq])| remove(var=\[aq]fm_subtitle\[aq]) %}
    <tr><th>{{ k }}:</th><th>{{ v }}</th></tr>
  {% endfor %}
  </table>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The error page template `\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer_error\f[R]' (see below)
does not provide `\f[C]fm_*\f[R]' variables, because of possible header
syntax errors.
Instead, the variable `\f[C]{{ note_error }}\f[R]' contains the error
message as raw UTF-8 and the variable
`\f[C]{{ note_erroneous_content_html }}\f[R]' the HTML rendition of the
text source with clickable hyperlinks:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[viewer_error]
error = \[aq]\[aq]\[aq]<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=\[rs]\[dq]en\[rs]\[dq]>

.PP
\f[B]Customize the built-in HTML exporter\f[R]
.PP
Customizing Tp-Note\[cq]s HTML export function works the same way as
customizing the built-in viewer.
There are some slight differences though: The role of the
`\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer\f[R]' template - discussed above - is taken
over by the `\f[C][tmpl_html] exporter\f[R]' template.
In this template the same \f[I]Tera\f[R] variables are available, except
`\f[C]{{ note_js }}\f[R]' which does not make sense in this context.
As the exporter prints possible rendition error messages on the console,
there is no equivalent to the `\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer_error\f[R]'
template.
Note, in contrast to the previous template
`\f[C][tmpl_html] viewer\f[R]' example, the source code highlighting CSS
code is now embedded in the HTML output with
`\f[C]<style>{{ note_css }}</style>\f[R]'
.SS Choose your favorite web browser as note viewer
.PP
Once the note is rendered into HTML, Tp-Note\[cq]s internal HTTP server
connects to a random port at the `\f[C]localhost\f[R]' interface where
the rendition is served to be viewed with a web browser.
Tp-Note\[cq]s configuration file contains a list
`\f[C][app_args] browser\f[R]' with common web browsers and their usual
location on disk.
This list is executed top down until a web browser is found and
launched.
If you want to view your notes with a different web browser, simply
modify the `\f[C][app_args] browser\f[R]' list and put your favorite web
browser on top.
.PP
In case none of the listed browsers can be found, Tp-Note switches into
a fall back mode with limited functionality, where it tries to open the
system\[cq]s default web browser.
A disadvantage is, that in fall back mode Tp-Note is not able to detect
when the user closes the web browser.
This might lead to situations, where Tp-Note\[cq]s internal HTTP server
shuts down to early.
In order to check if Tp-Note finds the selected web browser as intended,
invoke Tp-Note with `\f[C]tpnote --debug info --popup --view\f[R]'.
.SH TEMPLATES
.PP
All \f[I]TP-Note\f[R]\[cq]s workflows are customizable through its
templates which are grouped in the `\f[C][tmpl]\f[R]' section of
\f[I]Tp-Nots\f[R]\[cq]s configuration file.
Configuration file variables ending with `\f[C]tmpl.*_content\f[R]'
and `\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]' are \f[I]Tera\f[R] template strings
(see: <https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#templates>).
.PP
Tp-Note captures and stores its environment in \f[I]Tera variables\f[R].
For example, the variable `\f[C]{{ dir_path }}\f[R]' is initialized with
the note\[cq]s target directory.
The variable `\f[C]{{ clipboard }}\f[R]' contains the content of the
clipboard.
To learn more about Tera variables, launch Tp-Note with the
`\f[C]--debug trace\f[R]' option and observe what information it
captures from its environment.
.SS Template types
.PP
The content of a new note is composed by one of Tp-Note\[cq]s internal
customizable templates, hence the name Tp-Note, where \f[I]Tp\f[R]
stands for \[lq]template\[rq].
Which of the internal templates is applied depends on the context in
which Tp-Note is invoked: e.g.\ the template for clipboard text input is
called `\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]'.
If the clipboard contains text with a YAML header, the template
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_content\f[R]' is used.
.PP
In total, there are 5 different `\f[C]tmpl.*_content\f[R]' templates:
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.new_content\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_content\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_content\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_content\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_content\f[R]'
.PP
In general, the templates are designed in a way, that the text input
stream -usually originating from the clipboard- ends up in the body of
the note file, whereas the environment -such as the username- ends up in
the header of the note file.
.PP
Once the content of the new note is set by one of the content templates,
another template type comes into play: the so-called \f[I]filename
template\f[R].
Each content template has a corresponding filename template, e.g.:
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.new_filename\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_filename\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_filename\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_filename\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.annotate_file_filename\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' (no corresponding content template)
.PP
As the name suggests, the role of a filename template is to determine
the filename of the new note.
This is done by evaluating (deserializing) it\[cq]s YAML header.
The values of the note\[cq]s YAML header fields are can be accessed in
filename templates through various `\f[C]{{ fm_<key> }}\f[R]'
dynamically created template variables.
For example the value of the YAML header field `\f[C]title:\f[R]' can be
accessed with `\f[C]{{ fm_title }}\f[R]'.
Once the filename is set, Tp-Note writes out the new note on disk.
.PP
Most of the above templates are dedicated to the creation of new note
files.
However, two of them have a special role: \f[I]prepend header to text
file\f[R] and \f[I]synchronize filename\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Prepend header to text file\f[R] (new feature in Tp-Note v1.16.0):
When Tp-Note opens a regular text file without a YAML header, a new
header is prepended automatically.
It\[cq]s data origins mainly form the filename of the text file.
The templates applied in this use case are:
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_content\f[R]' and
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_filename\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Synchronize filename\f[R]: This function mode is invoked when
[Tp-Note] opens an existing note file, after it\[cq]s YAML header is
evaluated.
The extracted header information is then applied to the
`\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template and the resulting filename is
compared to the actual filename on disk.
If they differ, [Tp-Note] renames the note file.
The `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template operates on its own
without a corresponding content template.
.PP
Note, that in the operation mode \f[I]synchronize filename\f[R], the
header data overwrites the filename of the note, whereas in the
operation mode \f[I]prepend header\f[R] the filename data is copied into
the new prepended header.
Keep in mind, that even in the latter mode the filename might change
slightly.
This is because after the header creation with the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_content\f[R]' template, the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_text_file_filename\f[R]' template is applied, which
might cause a slight filename modification due to its sanitization
filters (cf.\ `\f[C]sanit()\f[R]' in the section \f[I]Template
filters\f[R]).
.PP
You can disable the \f[I]prepend header\f[R] feature by setting the
configuration file variable
`\f[C]arg_default.add_header = false\f[R]'.
To disable all filename synchronization, set
`\f[C]arg_default.no_filename_sync = true\f[R]'.
This guarantees, that Tp-Note will never change neither the filename nor
the YAML header of an existing file.
.PP
For a more detailed description of templates and their defaults, please
consult the `\f[C]const\f[R]' definitions in Tp-Note\[cq]s source code
file `\f[C]note.rs\f[R]'.
.SS Template variables
.PP
All Tera template variables and
functions (https://tera.netlify.com/docs/#templates) can be used within
Tp-Note\[cq]s templates.
For example `\f[C]{{ get_env(name=\[aq]LANG\[aq]) }}\[aq]\f[R] gives you
access to the'\f[C]LANG\f[R]\[cq] environment variable.
.PP
In addition, Tp-Note defines the following variables:
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' is the canonicalized fully qualified path name
corresponding to Tp-Note\[cq]s positional command line parameter
`\f[C]<path>\f[R]'.
If none was given on the command line, `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' contains
the current working directory path.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ dir_path }}\f[R]' is identical to `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' with
one exception: if `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to a file, the last
component (the file name) is omitted and only the directory path is
retained.
If `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to a directory,
`\f[C]{{ dir_path }}\f[R]' equals `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_fm_text }}\f[R]': is the header as raw text of the file
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to.
Note, this variable is only available in the templates
`\f[C]from_text_file_*\f[R]', `\f[C]sync_filename\f[R]' and the HTML
templates below.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_body_text }}\f[R]': is the content of the file
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to.
If the file does not start with a front matter, this variable holds the
whole content.
Note, this variable is only available in the templates
`\f[C]from_text_file_*\f[R]', `\f[C]sync_filename\f[R]' and the HTML
templates below.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ note_file_date }}\f[R]': is the file system creation date of
the file `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to.
Note, this variable is only available in the templates
`\f[C]from_text_file_*\f[R]', `\f[C]sync_filename\f[R]' and the HTML
templates below.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard }}\f[R]' is the complete clipboard text.
In case the clipboard\[cq]s content starts with a YAML header, the
latter does not appear in this variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard_header }}\f[R]' is the YAML section of the clipboard
data, if one exists.
Otherwise: empty string.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ stdin }}\f[R]' is the complete text content originating from
the input stream `\f[C]stdin\f[R]'.
This stream can replace the clipboard when it is not available.
In case the input stream\[cq]s content starts with a YAML header, the
latter does not appear in this variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ stdin_header }}\f[R]' is the YAML section of the input stream,
if one exists.
Otherwise: empty string.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ extension_default }}\f[R]' is the default extension for new
notes (can be changed in the configuration file),
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ username }}\f[R]' is the content of the first non-empty
environment variable: `\f[C]TPNOTEUSER\f[R]', `\f[C]LOGNAME\f[R]',
`\f[C]USER\f[R]' or `\f[C]USERNAME\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ lang }}\f[R]' contains the user\[cq]s language tag as defined
in RFC 5646 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt).
Not to be confused with the UNIX `\f[C]LANG\f[R]' environment variable
from which this value is derived under Linux/MacOS.
Under Windows, the user\[cq]s language tag is queried through the
WinAPI.
If defined, the environment variable `\f[C]TPNOTELANG\f[R]' overwrites
the value of `\f[C]{{ lang }}\f[R]' (all operating systems).
.PP
The following `\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' variables are typically generated,
\f[I]after\f[R] a content template was filled in with data: For example
a field named `\f[C]title:\f[R]' in the content template
`\f[C]tmpl.new_content\f[R]' will generate the variable
`\f[C]fm_title\f[R]' which can then be used in the corresponding
`\f[C]tmpl.new_filename\f[R]' filename template.
`\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' variables are generated dynamically.
This means, a YAML front-matter variable `\f[C]foo:\f[R]' in a note will
generate a `\f[C]{{ fm_foo }}\f[R]' template variable.
On the other hand, a missing `\f[C]foo:\f[R]' will cause
`\f[C]{{ fm_foo }}\f[R]' to be undefined.
.PP
Please note that `\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' variables are available in all
filename templates and in the
`\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_content\f[R]' content template only.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_title }}\f[R]' is the `\f[C]title:\f[R]' as indicated in the
YAML front-matter of the note.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_subtitle }}\f[R]' is the `\f[C]subtitle:\f[R]' as indicated
in the YAML front matter of the note.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_author }}\f[R]' is the `\f[C]author:\f[R]' as indicated in
the YAML front-matter of the note.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_lang }}\f[R]' is the `\f[C]lang:\f[R]' as indicated in the
YAML front-matter of the note.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_file_ext }}\f[R]' holds the value of the optional YAML
header variable `\f[C]file_ext:\f[R]'
(e.g.\ `\f[C]file_ext: \[dq]rst\[dq]\f[R]').
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_sort_tag }}\f[R]': The sort tag variable as defined in the
YAML front matter of this note
(e.g.\ `\f[C]sort_tag: \[dq]20200312-\[dq]\f[R]').
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_all }}\f[R]': is a collection (map) of all defined
`\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' variables.
It is used in the `\f[C]tmpl.from_clipboard_yaml_content\f[R]'
template, typically in a loop like:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{% for key, value in fm_all %}{{ key }}: {{ value | json_encode }}
{% endfor %}
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.PP
Important: there is no guarantee, that any of the above
`\f[C]{{ fm_* }}\f[R]' variables are defined! Depending on the last
content template result, certain variables might be undefined.
Please take into consideration, that a defined variable might contain
the empty string `\f[C]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]'.
.PP
For a more detailed description of the available template variables,
please consult the `\f[C]const\f[R]' definitions in Tp-Note\[cq]s source
code file `\f[C]note.rs\f[R]'.
.SS Template filters
.PP
In addition to \f[I]Tera\f[R]\[cq]s built-in
filters (https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#built-in-filters), Tp-Note comes
with some additional filters, e.g.: `\f[C]tag\f[R]',
`\f[C]trim_tag\f[R]', `\f[C]stem\f[R]', `\f[C]cut\f[R]',
`\f[C]heading\f[R]', `\f[C]link_text\f[R]', `\f[C]link_dest\f[R]',
`\f[C]link_title\f[R]' and `\f[C]ext\f[R]'.
.PP
A filter is always used together with a variable.
Here are some examples:
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path |\ filename }}\f[R]' returns the final component of
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'.
If `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]' points to a file, the filter returns the
complete filename including its sort tag, stem, copy-counter, dot and
extension.
If the `\f[C]<path>\f[R]' points to a directory, the filter returns the
final directory name.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path | tag }}\f[R]' is the sort tag (numerical filename prefix)
of the final component of `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]',
e.g.\ `\f[C]01-23_9-\f[R]' or `\f[C]20191022-\f[R]'.
It is similar to `\f[C]{{ path |\ filename }}\f[R]' but without
returning its stem, copy-counter and extension.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path |\ stem }}\f[R]' is similar to
`\f[C]{{ path |\ filename }}\f[R]' but without its sort tag,
copy-counter and extension.
Only the stem of `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'\[cq]s last component is
returned.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path |\ copy_counter }}\f[R]' is similar to
`\f[C]{{ path |\ filename }}\f[R]' but without its sort tag, stem and
extension.
Only the copy counter of `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'\[cq]s last component is
returned.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path | ext }}\f[R]' is `\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'\[cq]s file
extension without dot (period), e.g.\ `\f[C]txt\f[R]' or `\f[C]md\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path | ext |\ prepend_dot }}\f[R]' is
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]'\[cq]s file extension with dot (period),
e.g.\ `\f[C].md\f[R]' or `\f[C].md\f[R]'.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ path | trim_tag }}\f[R]' returns the final component of
`\f[C]path\f[R]' which might be a directory name or a file name.
Unlike the `\f[C]filename\f[R]' filter (which also returns the final
component), `\f[C]trim_tag\f[R]' trims the sort tag if there is one.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ dir_path | trim_tag }}\f[R]' returns the final component of
`\f[C]dir_path\f[R]' (which is the final directory name in
`\f[C]{{ path }}\f[R]').
Unlike the `\f[C]filename\f[R]' filter (which also returns the final
component), `\f[C]trim_tag\f[R]' trims the sort tag if there is one.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | cut }}\f[R]' is the first 200 bytes from the
clipboard.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | heading }}\f[R]' is the clipboard\[cq]s content
until the end of the first sentence, or the first newline.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_text }}\f[R]' is the name of the first
Markdown or ReStructuredText formatted link in the clipboard.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_dest }}\f[R]' is the URL of the first Markdown
or ReStruncturedText formatted link in the clipboard.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ clipboard | link_title }}\f[R]' is the title of the first
Markdown or ReStruncturedText formatted link in the clipboard.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ username | capitalize | json_encode }}\f[R]' is the capitalized
JSON encoded username.
As all YAML front-matter is JSON encoded, this filter code must be
appended to any template variable placed in the front-matter block.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_subtitle | sanit }}\f[R]' is the note\[cq]s subtitle as
defined in its front-matter, sanitized in a file system friendly form.
Special characters are omitted or replaced by `\f[C]-\f[R]' and
`\f[C]_\f[R]'.
See the section \f[I]Filename template convention\f[R] for more details
about this filter.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_title | sanit(force_alpha=true) }}\f[R]' is the note\[cq]s
title as defined in its front-matter.
Same as above, but strings starting with a sort tag are prepended by an
apostrophe to avoid ambiguity.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]{{ fm_all | remove(var=\[aq]fm_title\[aq]) }}\f[R]' represents a
collection (map) of all `\f[C]fm_*\f[R]' variables, exclusive of the
variable `\f[C]fm_title\f[R]'.
.SS Content template conventions
.PP
Tp-Note distinguishes two template types: content templates are used to
create the note\[cq]s content (front-matter and body) and the
corresponding filename templates `\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]' are used
to calculate the note\[cq]s filename.
By convention, content templates appear in the configuration file in
variables named `\f[C]tmpl.*_content\f[R]'.
.PP
Strings in the YAML front-matter of content templates are JSON encoded.
Therefore, all variables used in the front-matter must pass an
additional `\f[C]json_encode()\f[R]'-filter.
For example, the variable `\f[C]{{ dir_path | stem }}\f[R]' becomes
`\f[C]{{ dir_path | stem() | json_encode() }}\f[R]' or just
`\f[C]{{ dir_path | stem | json_encode }}\f[R]'.
.SS Filename template conventions
.PP
By convention, filename templates appear in the configuration file in
variables named `\f[C]tmpl.*_filename\f[R]'.
When a content template creates a new note, the corresponding filename
template is called afterwards to calculate the filename of the new note.
Please note that, the filename template `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]'
has a special role as it synchronizes the filename of existing note
files.
Besides this, as we are dealing with filenames we must guarantee, that
the filename templates produce only file system friendly characters.
For this purpose Tp-Note provides the additional Tera filters
`\f[C]sanit\f[R]' and `\f[C]sanit(force_alpha=true)\f[R]':
.IP \[bu] 2
The `\f[C]sanit()\f[R]' filter transforms a string in a file system
friendly from.
This is done by replacing forbidden characters like `\f[C]?\f[R]' and
`\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]\f[R]' with `\f[C]_\f[R]' or space.
This filter can be used with any variable, but is most useful with
filename templates.
For example, in the `\f[C]tmpl.sync_filename\f[R]' template, we find
the expression `\f[C]{{ subtitle | sanit }}\f[R]'.
Note that the filter recognizes strings that represent a so-called dot
file name and treats them a little differently by prepending them with
an apostrophe: a dot file is a file whose name starts with `\f[C].\f[R]'
and that does not contain whitespace.
It may or may not end with a file extension.
The apostrophe preserves the following dot from being filtered.
.IP \[bu] 2
`\f[C]sanit(force_alpha=true)\f[R]' is similar to the above, with one
exception: when a string starts with a digit `\f[C]0123456789\f[R]' or
`\f[C]-_\f[R]', the whole string is prepended with \f[C]\[aq]\f[R].
For example: \[lq]\f[C]1 The Show Begins\f[R]\[rq] becomes
\[lq]\f[C]\[aq]1 The Show   Begins\f[R]\[rq].
This filter should always be applied to the first variable assembling
the new filename,
e.g.\ `\f[C]{{ title | sanit(force_alpha=true )}\f[R]'.
This way, it is always possible to distinguish the sort tag from the
actual filename.
The default sort tag separator `\f[C]\[aq]\f[R]' can be changed with the
configuration variable `\f[C]filename.sort_tag_extra_separator\f[R]'.
.PP
In filename templates most variables must pass either the
`\f[C]sanit\f[R]' or the `\f[C]sanit(force_alpha=true)\f[R]' filter.
Exception to this rule are the sort tag variables
`\f[C]{{ path | tag }}\f[R]' and `\f[C]{{ dir_path | tag }}\f[R]'.
As these are guaranteed to contain only the file system friendly
characters `\f[C]0123456789 -_\f[R]', no additional filtering is
required.
Please note that in this case a `\f[C]sanit\f[R]'-filter would
needlessly restrict the value range of sort tags as they usually end
with a `\f[C]-\f[R]', a character, which the `\f[C]sanit\f[R]'-filter
screens out when it appears in leading or trailing position.
For this reason no `\f[C]sanit\f[R]'-filter is not allowed with
`\f[C]{{ path | tag }}\f[R]' and `\f[C]{{ dir_path | tag }}\f[R]'.
.SH SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS
.PP
As discussed above, Tp-Note\[cq]s built-in viewer sets up an HTTP server
on the `\f[C]localhost\f[R]' interface with a random port number.
.PP
For security reasons, Tp-Note limits the set of files the viewer is able
to publish.
To summarize, a file is only served:
.IP "1." 3
when it is referenced in one of the currently viewed Tp-Note files,
.IP "2." 3
when its file extension is registered with the
`\f[C][viewer] served_mime_type\f[R]' list,
.IP "3." 3
if the number of so far viewed Tp-Note files,
`\f[C][viewer] displayed_tpnote_count_max\f[R]' is not exceeded,
.IP "4." 3
when it\[cq]s located under a directory containing a marker file named
`\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' (without marker file this condition is void).
.PP
The HTTP server runs as long as the launched web browser window is open.
Note, that the server not only exposes the displayed note file, but also
all referenced inline images and other linked TP-Note files.
Internally, the viewer maintains a list of \f[I]referenced local
URLs\f[R].
For security reasons, only listed files are served.
To limit data exfiltration in case an attacker gains access to an
account on your machine, the number of served Tp-Note files is limited
by the configurable value
`\f[C][viewer] displayed_tpnote_count_max\f[R]'.
.PP
In addition to the above quantitative restriction, Tp-Note\[cq]s
built-in viewer serves only files whose file extensions are registered
with the `\f[C][viewer] served_mime_type\f[R]' configuration file
variable.
The latter allows to disable the \f[I]follow links to other Tp-Note
files\f[R] feature by removing all `\f[C]text/*\f[R]' mime types from
that list.
.PP
Another security feature is the `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' marker file.
When Tp-Note opens a note file, it checks all directories above, one by
one, until it finds the marker file `\f[C]tpnoteroot\f[R]'.
Tp-Note\[cq]s viewer will never serve a file located outside the root
directory and its children.
When no `\f[C].tpnoteroot\f[R]' file is found, the root directory is set
to `\f[C]/\f[R]', which disables this security feature.
.PP
As Tp-Note\[cq]s built-in viewer binds to the `\f[C]localhost\f[R]'
interface, the exposed files are in principle accessible to all
processes running on the computer.
As long as only one user is logged into the computer at a given time, no
privacy concern is raised: any potential attacker must be logged in, in
order to access the \f[C]localhost\f[R] HTTP server.
.PP
This is why on systems where multiple users are logged in at the same
time, it is recommended to disable Tp-Note\[cq]s internal HTTP server by
setting the configuration file variable
`\f[C]arg_default.edit = true\f[R]'.
Alternatively, you can also compile Tp-Note without the
`\f[C]viewer\f[R]' feature.
Note, that even if the viewer feature disabled, the `\f[C]--export\f[R]'
command line option still works: This allows the authorized user to
render the note to HTML manually.
.PP
\f[B]Summary\f[R]: As long as Tp-Note\[cq]s built-in note viewer is
running, the note file and all its referenced (image) files are exposed
to all users logged into the computer at that given time.
This concerns only local users, Tp-Note never exposes any information to
the network or on the Internet.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
TPNOTELANG
Tp-Note stores the user\[cq]s locale settings in the template variable
`\f[C]{{ lang }}\f[R]'.
When set, `\f[C]TPNOTELANG\f[R]' overwrites the locale settings.
.TP
TPNOTEUSER
The template variable `\f[C]{{ username }}\f[R]' is the content of the
first non-empty variable: `\f[C]TPNOTEUSER\f[R]', `\f[C]LOGNAME\f[R]',
`\f[C]USER\f[R]' or `\f[C]USERNAME\f[R]'.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
Normally the exit status is `\f[C]0\f[R]' when the note file was
processed without error or `\f[C]1\f[R]' otherwise.
If Tp-Note can not read or write its configuration file, the exit status
is `\f[C]5\f[R]'.
.PP
When `\f[C]tpnote -n -b <FILE>\f[R]' returns the code `\f[C]0\f[R]', the
note file has a valid YAML header with a `\f[C]title:\f[R]' field.
In addition, when `\f[C]tpnote -n -b -x - <FILE>\f[R]' returns the code
`\f[C]0\f[R]', the note\[cq]s body was rendered without error.
