tp-note is a note-taking-tool and a template system, that consistently
synchronizes the note’s meta-data with its filename. tp-note collects various
information about its environment and the clipboard, and stores them in
variables. New notes are created by filling these variables in predefined and
customizable “Tera”-templates. In case the positional command-line-parameter
“<path>” points to an existing “tp-note”-file, the note’s meta-data is analysed
and, if necessary, its filename is modified. For all other file types, tp-note
creates a new note that annotates the file “<path>” points to. If “<path>” is a
directory (or, when omitted the current working directory), a new note is
created in that directory. After creation, tp-note launches an external editor
of your choice. Although the note’s structure follows “pandoc”-conventions, it
is not tied to any specific markup language.
