_Tp-Note_ is a note taking tool and a template system, that synchronizes the
note's metadata with its filename. _Tp-Note_ collects various information
about its environment and the clipboard and stores it in variables. New
notes are created by filling these variables in predefined and customizable
`Tera`-templates. In case `<path>` points to an existing _Tp-Note_-file, the
note's metadata is analysed and, if necessary, its filename is adjusted.
For all other file types, _Tp-Note_ creates a new note annotating the
file `<path>` points to. If `<path>` is a directory (or, when omitted the
current working directory), a new note is created in that directory. After
creation, _Tp-Note_ launches an external editor of your choice. Although the
templates are written for Markdown, _Tp-Note_ is not tied to
any specific markup language. However, _Tp-Note_ comes with an optional
viewer feature, that currently renders only Markdown, ReStructuredText and
HTML. Note, that there is also some limited support for Asciidoc and
WikiText. The note's rendition with its hyperlinks is live updated and
displayed in the user's webbrowser.
