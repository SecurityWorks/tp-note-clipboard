The `tpnote-lib` library is designed to embed Tp-Note's core function
in common text editors and text editor plugins. It is dealing with templates
and input files and is also part of the command line application
[Tp-Note](https://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/).  The library
provides a default configuration in the static variable `LIB_CFG` that can
be customized at runtime.
